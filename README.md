What is this?

In the meantime, the idea is to collect a number of pre-configured Firefox
profile templates for use with Selenium.  That is, templates that:

  * Are easy to enable
  * Do not cause Selenium to complain or behave oddly (e.g., no "New Add-on"
    popup at FF launch)
  * Include additional Firefox extensions for use during test runs (e.g., Firebug)
